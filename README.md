# SeiyuuSync
*SeiyuuSync* is an application that lets me look up anime shows and view its
voice actors. What makes this different than other services online is that it
filters the results to only show other shows that I've watched. This project is
a C# WinForms application with a MongoDB database. It also leverages the
*MyAnimeList* API and *AniList* API for anime and voice actor data.
